<h1>POST HEADER</h1>
<h3>POST SUB HEADER</h3>

An attempt for a flexible layout which reacts little to the screen/browser re-size.

Responsiveness is awesomeness. 
<br/>
WikiPedia Source - 
A site designed as responsive uses CSS3 media queries, an extension of the @media rule, to adapt the layout to the viewing environment—along with fluid proportion-based grids and flexible images.

    Media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules based on characteristics of the device the site is being displayed on, most commonly the width of the browser.
    The fluid grid concept calls for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages or EMs, rather than absolute units like points (which are typically for print media), inches, centimeters, etc.[ Note that in CSS, pixels are considered relative units.; however, they are not relative to the size of the font (as with EMs and percentages).
    Flexible images are also sized in relative units (other than pixels), such as to prevent them from displaying outside their containing element. However, this is often not the best practice as browsers are not particularly adept at scaling images.  It is often preferable to use CSS background images that can be switched by media queries and/or handheld style sheets as this prevents the browser from downloading images that are larger than what it needs to render.
